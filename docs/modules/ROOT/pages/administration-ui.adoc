== Configuration via AdminWebModule
The configuration of an `LdapConnector` and `LdapUserDirectory` is easiest done by using the {url-AdminWebModule}[AdminWebModule].
After logging into the {url-AdminWebModule}[AdminWebModule], create a new `LdapConnector` by using the navigation.

Currently, the LdapModule support following LDAP directories:

* https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/[Apache Directory Service 1.5]
* https://opends.java.net/[OpenDS]
* https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742424.aspx[Microsoft Active Directory]
