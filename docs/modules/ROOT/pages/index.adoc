= LdapModule

The LdapModule provides a services for connecting to LDAP directories.
It provides a domain model for configuring LDAP connections and integrating them with an authentication layer.
If <<user-module-url,UserModule>> is also present support for synchronizing users and groups from LDAP will also be active.

Currently, the LdapModule support following LDAP directories:

* https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/[Apache Directory Service 1.5]
* https://opends.java.net/[OpenDS]
* https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742424.aspx[Microsoft Active Directory]

== Configuration

Adding the dependency to {admin-web-module-url}[LdapModule] will automatically register a synchronization task which runs every 5 minutes.
The task will not run until an `LdapConnector` and `LdapUserDirectory` are created.
